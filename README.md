# Interactive Photo Gallery

## Overview

This project is an interactive photo gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The gallery is designed to be responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices. It matches the provided Figma designs pixel-perfectly, includes hover interactions, and ensures cross-browser compatibility.

Additionally, the project includes solutions to two coding challenges focused on array manipulation and string transformation.

```

## Usage

### Viewing the Gallery
- Simply open index.html in your browser to see the gallery.
- Hover over each image to see additional information move up into view.

## Coding Challenges

### Challenge 1: Array Manipulation
The file `Challenges/arrayMap.js` contains the solution to the following problem:

### Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target. Return true if such a subarray exists, otherwise return false.

### Challenge 2: String Transformation
The file `Challenges/stringTransform.js` contains the solution to the following problem:

### Problem Statement:
Given a string, transform it based on the following rules:

If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the order specified above.
